# Job Assignment API

## Summary
Your task is to build a Resourcing API using the Java Spring Boot framework, that allows consumers to assign temps to jobs.

### Endpoints

POST /jobs - Creates a job

PATCH /jobs/{id} - Updates job, endpoint should be used to assign temps to jobs

GET /jobs - Fetch all jobs

GET /jobs?assigned={true|false} - Filter by whether a job is assigned to a temp or not

GET /jobs/{id} - (id, name, tempId, startDate, endDate)

POST /temps - Create a temp

GET /temps - List all temps

GET /temps?jobId={jobId} - List temps that are available for a job based on the jobs date range

GET /temps/{id} - get temp by id (should also display jobs they’ve been assigned to)

Example Payloads

// GET /jobs/{id}

```
{
	id: ...,
	name: ...,
	startDate: ...,
	endDate: ...,
	temp: {
		id: ...,
		firstName: ...,
		lastName: ...,
	} // temp can also be null if a temp hasn't been assigned to the job
}
```

// GET /temps/{id}

```
{
	id: ...,
	firstName: ...,
	lastName: ...,
	jobs: [{
		id: ...,
		name: ...,
		startDate: ...,
		endDate: ...,
	}, ...] // can be empty if temp hasn't been assigned to jobs
}
```

##### Assumptions

Temps can only have one job at a time (can’t be doing 2 jobs on the same date)

Temps can have many jobs, and job can have 1 temp assigned

Should be able to assign existing temps to jobs via POST /jobs & PATCH /jobs/{id}

You must use a relational database

Bonus

Temps should be able to manage other temps (will require an additional field)

When you request a temp record it should display the reports of that temp

Should be represented in the database as a nested set

GET /temps/tree - should display the whole tree of temps
